Using Capacitance Sensors</a></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<a href="">During the first part of Week 4, I built a circuit that involved a Capacitance Sensor. In this case, I used two metal sheets that charged up from a pin from the Metro board that provided the charge. One of the metal sheets would be connected to ground and the other to the circuit. Another pin from the Metro Board was connected to the circuit, that would sense the charging up. The close the two metal sheets were together, the higher the capacitance is for the sensor(metal sheets). Based on this correlation, it can be noted that the time it takes to fully charge up the CAP is determined by the amount of capacitance, which is determined by the distance between the two metal sheets.</a>
<h2> </h2>
<a href="">The Arduino program record how long (time) it takes for the metal plates to fully charge and displays it on the application. By positioning the metal sheets in different ways, I observed many types of data changes on the Arduino Program:</a>
<h6> </h6> <a href="">
When both plates are in contact with either hand: -2
<h2> </h2>
When both plates touch each other completely: 20000-80000 initially; then remains at -2
<h2> </h2>
When both metal sheets are in partial contact with each other: 3000-5000
<h2> </h2>

<h2> </h2>
I re-used the same circuit, but with a capacitance sensor that I made using home materials, of aluminum foil and a sponge. This time, instead of recording the numbers displayed on the Arduino program based on position of the two sheets, I instead came up with a new method of testing the sensor. I decided to use different writing utensils on a plate of the sensor to see how it affects the charge time. And here were the results:
<h2> </h2>
Using a Pen: 1200-1800
<h2> </h2>
Unsharpened Pencil: 2000
<h2> </h2>
Regular sharpened Pencil: 3000
<h2> </h2>
Eraser: 1800-2100
<h2> </h2>
No writing object used: 10-70
<h2> </h2>
It could be a possibility, that this observation method could be used to create a way to test and see the structural integrity of a writing object. Also, if the information (time numbers) reading on the Arduino program can be slowed down, that information could possibly be used to identify what series of numbers are produced when each alphabetical letter or number is written on the aluminum sheet. That could possibly used as a code language using the corresponding numbers that each letter produces when written.

<h2><a href="">Output Devices</a></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<a href="">For the second part of Week-4, we had to create a device that would produce an output, when sensing an input (through Arduino). We learnt how to connect a buzzer on a Breadboard, and wire it up to the metroboard, in order to make it buzz. I also previously learned how to seek input from a Capacitative Sensor. Using that knowledge, I created a circuit, where the input device being the Capacitative Sensor, when showing a reading of a certain value or higher (on the Serial Moniter), will set off the output Buzzer device. I used Arduino codes to instruct for this process to happen.
<h1> </h1>
<h6>Here is the Arduino Code referred to above:</h6>
<img src="./Screenshot%20(190).png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:50%" alt="Sew">
<h1> </h1>
A human hand, when coming into contact with the Metal Sheet (capacitative sensor), will set off the required input value/number. Therefore, the Buzzer will start ringing when I touch the capacitative sensor.
